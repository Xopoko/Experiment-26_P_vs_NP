2306.02184	Polynomial Identity Testing and the Ideal Proof System: PIT is in NP if   and only if IPS can be p-simulated by a Cook-Reckhow proof system	Joshua A. Grochow	cs.CC cs.LO	2023	2023-06-06	11	https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.02184	https://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.02184.pdf	The Ideal Proof System (IPS) of Grochow & Pitassi (FOCS 2014, J. ACM, 2018) is an algebraic proof system that uses algebraic circuits to refute the solvability of unsatisfiable systems of polynomial equations. One potential drawback of IPS is that verifying an IPS proof is only known to be doable using Polynomial Id...

This recovers the classical definition when $Q$ is a field, and more generally includes all flat deformations of Koszul alg...
