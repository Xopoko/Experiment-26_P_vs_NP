Q43.S306 note

- Purpose: connect quasi-poly log2 bounds to the Thm. 4.1 regime-d log2 threshold.
- Lemmas: Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_param_of_scaled and
  Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_param_of_quasipoly.
- Inputs: n>=2, N<=2^(log2|F|)^(c+1), and the scaled log2^5 condition.
- Output: Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_param n N.
