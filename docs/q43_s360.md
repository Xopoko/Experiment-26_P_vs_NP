# Q43.S360 reduction note
Goal: reduce the natural-proofs exit for the band-log2 predicate to density or constructivity bounds.
If the predicate is non-large (density < 2^{-poly(n)}), it is not P/poly-natural by RR97.
If the predicate is non-constructive (no poly-time truth-table test), RR97 also does not apply.
Thus proving either bound is sufficient to avoid the RR97 barrier for the PIT/IPS mapping lemma.
Lean target: formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean (future: encode density/constructivity predicates).
Dependencies: docs/q43_s359.md; razborov_rudich_1997.pdf Thm. 4.1 p.3.
