# Q39.S153 barrier certificate

This run records a relativization barrier for the XOR-step mapping lemma: the planned
mapping uses only arithmetic/log2 and syntactic XOR transformations, so it is oracle-agnostic.
Any proof that relies only on this mapping would relativize.

Exact citation: J. Katz (2005), "Relativizing the P vs. NP Question" (lecture notes),
Claim 1, p.1 of the PDF (resources/downloads/jkatz_relativization_2005.pdf) constructs
an oracle B with P^B != NP^B, so any fully relativizing mapping lemma cannot settle P vs. NP.

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (mapping uses arithmetic/log2 + XOR syntax only).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented XOR gates and check the mapping proof remains unchanged.
  - Known oracle counterexample: Katz Claim 1 p.1 (BGS-style oracle separation).
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (lemma is a proof-system translation, not a circuit property).
  - Largeness: N/A.
  - Constructivity: N/A.
  - Usefulness: N/A.
  - Exit point: N/A.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown.
  - Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: compare with Aaronson-Wigderson 2008, "Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory",
    Thm. 5.3 p.23 (resources/downloads/aaronson_wigderson_2008.pdf).
