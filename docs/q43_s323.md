# Q43.S323 nk base compare C

For k>=13, we compare the explicit base bound
`2^(2k+1)/(2k+1)^5` against `2*C*c1` assuming `3*(2*C*c1) <= 2k+1`.
The proof uses `(2k+1)^6 <= 3*2^(2k+1)` and a mul/div rewrite.
This lemma (`Q43_gap_right_base_bound_of_c`) is meant to discharge hbase
in the gap-right lift after fixing an explicit `k0(C)`.

Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemma `Q43_gap_right_base_bound_of_c`).
