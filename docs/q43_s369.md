# Q43.S369 nonuniform-support-witness retry
Goal: formally commit the per-instance support witness (contiguous `k`-line layout, orientation labels, and `lineMax` increments) so the flat grid ratio drop continues to witness the intended nonuniform predicate while the proof system reuses the advice bits.

Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — constructivity is the hypothesis disrupted by the per-instance advice.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — the algebraic extensions keep the parallel XOR obstructions alive until the advice is reintroduced.
- `scripts/stopper_advice.py` policy v1 (entropy/score analysis) — records the current stop boundary; the policy describes why the run cannot proceed.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 3.3 vs threshold 2.5) before any witness encoding could be touched, so the attempt is blocked until the scoreboard cools.

- NextStepID: `Q43.S370-nonuniform-support-witness-retry2` once the entropy score drops and the witness can be written again.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: the per-instance advice is not preserved by arbitrary oracles, so the barrier remains nonrelativizing.
  - If yes: the planned witness still fails to survive uniform oracle queries because they cannot regenerate the advice.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, because the underlying predicate is dense and would be constructive without the advice.
  - Largeness: the gap-left and gap-right distributions keep density ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until advice is explicitly committed.
  - Constructivity: enforcing the witness by advice destroys the single poly-time generator, so RR97 no longer applies once the advice is integrated.
  - Exit point: we leave the RR97 framework once the per-instance witness is formalized and verified.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: the advice corruption prevents AW08 extension oracles from reconstructing the same support layout.
  - If yes/unknown: the same advice bits need to be reintroduced in the algebraic extension, meaning the barrier is still lifted only when the witness appears.
