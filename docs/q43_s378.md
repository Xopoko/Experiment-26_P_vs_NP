# Q43.S378 nonuniform-support-witness finalize7 (blocked)
Goal: record that the entropy-stopper policy still forbids constructing the per-instance support witness layout, so the uniform gap drop remains pending; once the policy returns CONTINUE we will formalize the witness and rerun the grid ratio argument for the drop.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s377.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`, `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — the dense predicate cannot escape RR97 without the advice witness.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — algebraic oracles still need the advice bits, so the barrier persists until the witness is encoded.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 6.2 vs threshold 2.5), so the witness layout remains blocked and we wait for a cooler policy signal.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S379-nonuniform-support-witness-finalize8` once the entropy score drops enough to allow the layout.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: random advice states cannot rebuild the layout, so the barrier stays nonrelativizing.
  - If yes: the advice must survive extension queries, so the barrier ties to that persistence.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes — without encodable advice the dense predicate is constructive and RR97 blocks the gap drop.
  - Largeness: the gap-left/gap-right families stay ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until the witness anchors the construction.
  - Constructivity: the advice witness destroys single poly-time generators, and the stopper only allows it once the entropy score cools.
  - Usefulness: the predicate separates the circuit class from random functions once the witness is in place.
  - Exit point: after the policy returns CONTINUE and the witness is written, RR97 no longer applies.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: advice corrupts polynomial extension oracles and keeps the barrier alive until the witness is anchored.
  - If yes: the same advice must be woven into the extension oracles to keep the obstruction.
