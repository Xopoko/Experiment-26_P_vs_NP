# Q43.S370 nonuniform-support-witness retry2
Goal: every grid needs a per-instance support witness that pins down the contiguous `k`-line orientations, their associated `lineMax` increments, and the advice bits that guarantee the observed ratio drop; formalizing this witness should show the nonuniform predicate keeps natural proofs at bay while the toy `gap_sqrt2` experiment still holds.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s369.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`, `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — a dense, constructive predicate still runs into RR97 if the advice witness is not enforced.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — AW08-style oracles would keep the ratio obstruction alive unless we tie the witness to instance-specific advice.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` now returned `CONTINUE` (score 0.7 < 2.5), so this run can attempt the witness encoding itself, but the barrier is that we still have to encode the advice bits without reintroducing constructivity; until that encoding is fleshed out the nonuniform-support plan is blocked.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_SUPPORT`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S371-nonuniform-support-witness-retry3` (restart the witness once the layout encoding stabilizes).
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: the per-instance advice cannot be generated by a uniform oracle, so random advice-relativizations still break the witness.
  - If yes: the witness must track the advice under every oracle so the barrier effectively lifts only once the layout encoding survives uniform extension queries.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes — without forcing the advice the predicate remains large and constructive, so RR97 continues to forbid the gap drop.
  - Largeness: the gap-left/gap-right families stay at density ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until the advice witness is introduced.
  - Constructivity: enforcing the support witness via advice removes the single poly-time generation path, so RR97 no longer applies once the encoding is anchored.
  - Usefulness: the advice witness separates `P/poly` from the targeted gap regime whenever the ratio drop is locked to the layout bits.
  - Exit point: successfully formalizing the advice-coded witness eliminates the constructivity condition and releases the RR97 constraint.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: the advice breaks polynomial extensions, so AW08-style oracles lose their grip once the layout is hard-coded.
  - If yes: the same advice bits must be woven into the algebraic extension to keep the barrier visible.
