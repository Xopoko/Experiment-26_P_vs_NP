Q43.S302-flat-eval-proofsize-to-linemax (Proof artifact).
- Added `Q43_tParam_lineMax_le_log2_poly_bound` to lift the polynomial log2 bound from proof size to lineMax.
- Uses `Q43_lineMax_le_proofSize` to connect lineMax with the total size bound.
- Lean anchor: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
- This is the line-level instantiation needed before the quasi-poly case.
