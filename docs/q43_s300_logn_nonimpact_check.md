Q43.S300-logn-nonimpact-check (Proof artifact).
- Added `Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param_of_log2` to lift the log2 N bound to the regime predicate.
- Routed `Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param_of_le` through the log2-bound lemma.
- Confirms the remaining log2 N dependency is isolated to the parameter bound.
- Lean anchor: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
- Notes: refactor only; proof behavior unchanged.
