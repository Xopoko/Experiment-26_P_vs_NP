# Q39.S156 contiguous alt-shift barrier note
Goal: explain why the contiguous-shift orbit remains rank 2 when pushing to `alt69`, reinforcing the relativization/algebrization obstruction and setting up the next shift `Q39.S157`.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s155.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean` (defs `Q39_globalfixedpair_fixedorientation_contiguous_shift_alt69_vec*`), `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`.
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — the oracle `B` separates `P^B` from `NP^B`, so any fully relativizing XOR mapping that never leaves the contiguous regime cannot resolve P vs NP.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — continuing oracle-augmented XOR sequences preserves the rank-2 witnesses, so the barrier stays intact up to `alt69`.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — even algebraic extension oracles keep the same XOR arithmetic behavior, so the barrier extends at least through this contiguous block.
Notes:
- The Lean definitions for `alt69` show two bitvectors with first six `true` entries before switching to `false`, matching the pattern from alt68; `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py` still produces rank 2 for this block.
- The invariants that survive are identical to the previous note: fixed global orientation, contiguous `true` prefix, and XOR transformations that depend only on arithmetic/log2. Each shift keeps the same witness, so the mapping fully relativizes.
- The contiguous shift can be indexed by `alt`; no local modification yet introduces oracle-dependent structure, so the barrier persists.
- A run contract for `Q39.S157-globalfixedpair-fixedorientation-contiguous-shift-alt70` was blocked at the entropy-stopper pre-check (`scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned 42 with score 1.7, cooldown signal) before the toy executed, so the uniform-contiguous attempt stays paused and the new barrier note is logged in `docs/q39_s157.md`.
- Next step: explore `Q39.S158-nonrelativizing-gadget` that breaks the contiguous pattern with an oracle-specific addition before restarting the contiguous alt-shift experiment.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (mapping uses arithmetic/log2 + XOR, so oracles commute with it).
  - Known counterexample: BGS75 Thm. 1 and Katz05 Claim 1.
  - Exit point: break the contiguous pattern with an oracle-specific gadget.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (AW08 Thm. 5.3 ensures algebraic extensions preserve the XOR barrier; the contiguous block extends under these oracles).
