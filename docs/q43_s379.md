# Q43.S379 nonuniform-support-witness finalize8 (blocked)
Goal: reissue the entropy-driven audit for the per-instance support witness layout, but log why the policy still forbids the final construction so the gap drop remains on hold; resume once CONTINUE returns.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s378.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`, `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — the dense predicate cannot escape RR97 without an advice witness.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — algebraic extension oracles still demand the advice bits, so the barrier persists until the witness is encoded.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 6.7 vs threshold 2.5, signals `repeat_failure` and `zero_infogain_streak>=2`), so the witness layout stays blocked and we await a cooler policy.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S380-nonuniform-support-witness-finalize9` once the entropy score drops enough to let the witness materialize.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: random advice states cannot rebuild the layout, so the barrier stays nonrelativizing.
  - If yes: the advice must survive extension queries, so the barrier ties to that persistence.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes — without encodable advice the dense predicate is constructive and RR97 blocks the gap drop.
  - Largeness: the gap-left/gap-right families keep density ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until the witness anchors the construction.
  - Constructivity: the advice witness destroys single poly-time generators, and the stopper only allows it once the entropy score cools.
  - Usefulness: the predicate separates the circuit class from random functions once the witness is in place.
  - Exit point: after the policy returns CONTINUE and the witness is written, RR97 no longer applies.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: advice corrupts polynomial extension oracles and keeps the barrier alive until the witness is anchored.
  - If yes: the same advice must be woven into the extension oracles to keep the obstruction.
