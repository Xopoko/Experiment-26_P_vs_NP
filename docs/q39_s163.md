# Q39.S163 gadget-support-audit (blocked)
Goal: inspect the gadget support guard and the contiguous alt-shift to see why the rank-2 witness survives; plan the extra per-output support bits or orientation metadata needed to break the relativizing continuation.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s161.md`, `docs/q39_s162.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`, `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — any gadget targeting the rank-2 witness must disrupt the relativizing continuation.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — the toy check reveals how the next shift still obeys the XOR symmetry.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — algebraic extensions keep the XOR rank invariant unless the gadget adds advice.
- `scripts/stopper_advice.py` policy v1 — pre-check score 2.5 triggered STOP before the audit could start.
Notes:
- `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score = 2.5, threshold = 2.5) so we cannot inspect the gadget support yet.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q39.S164-gadget-support-audit-retry` to retry the audit once the policy cools below the threshold.
- The artifact is a barrier note that records the STOP and pins the audit plan for the next run.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown (the gadget is supposed to break the uniform shift, but we cannot test it until the policy permits).
  - Exit point: the audit should reveal whether extra support bits or orientation data can disrupt the relativizing continuation.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (the focus is on gadget/shift invariants rather than large predicate constructs).
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (the gadget must also avoid AW08-style algebraic oracles to break XOR symmetry).
  - Algebraizing?: unknown (pre-check prevented empirical testing).
- Citations: [BGS75], [Katz05], [AW08], [`scripts/stopper_advice.py policy v1`].
