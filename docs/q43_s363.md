# Q43.S363 predicate refactor note
Goal: escape the RR97 constructivity requirement by replacing the band-log2 predicate with a witness-based predicate whose truth table is not P-time decidable.
Reduction: describe band-log2 as "exists support pattern S with grid ratios dropping across the log2 jump" so the decision requires exploring combinatorial support and cannot be read off a single truth table entry.
Dependencies: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (Q43_grid_ratio_mono_on_gap_right, Q43_gap_right_flat_eval_setup, Q43_gap_right_apply_n0) and `docs/q43_s359.md` (band-log2 PIT/IPS mapping plan).
Next: implement the support-witness predicate in Lean and show the reduced mapping still yields a PIT/IPS instance without invoking a new large constructive property.
