# Q39.S164 gadget-support-audit-retry (blocked)
Goal: reissue the gadget support audit with the next contiguous shift and confirm whether extra per-output bits/orientation data can break the rank-2 invariance; log why the entropy-stopper policy still forbids the inspection so the plan stays paused.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s163.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`, `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — any gadget must disconnect the uniform oracle extension to expose the rank-2 witness.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — the toy check shows the next contiguous shift still obeys the XOR symmetry unless additional advice breaks it.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — algebraic oracles preserve the XOR rank unless the gadget encodes per-output advice.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `python3 scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 5.3 vs threshold 2.5, signals `zero_infogain_streak>=2` and `cooldown_hit`), so the gadget audit is still blocked and we await a cooler policy.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q39.S165-globalfixedpair-fixedorientation-contiguous-shift-alt78` once the entropy score drops and the policy allows the audit to resume.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: the insurance plan should show the gadget disrupts the uniform extension, but the policy never let the audit run.
  - Exit point: when the policy clears, checking the next shift may reveal the extra per-output bits needed.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (we focus on gadget structure rather than density/constructivity).
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (the algebraic oracles still stabilize XOR rank, so the gadget must survive AW08-style extensions).
  - Algebraizing?: unknown (the policy prevented the experiment).
