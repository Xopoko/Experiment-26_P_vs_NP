# Q39.S151 barrier certificate

This run records a barrier for the XOR-step retry: the rank-only witness and fixed-partition
reasoning are oracle-agnostic, so any conclusion built solely from them relativizes and cannot
resolve P vs NP.

Exact citation: J. Katz, "Lecture on Relativization" (Notes on Complexity Theory; last updated 2008),
Claim 1, p.1 of the PDF (resources/downloads/jkatz_relativization_2005.pdf) constructs an oracle B
with P^B != NP^B, showing that relativizing techniques cannot decide P vs NP.

Exact citation: A. Razborov, S. Rudich (1997), "Natural Proofs", JCSS, Theorem 4.1, p.3 of the PDF
(resources/downloads/razborov_rudich_1997.pdf) gives the natural-proofs barrier for large constructive
properties.

Exact citation: S. Aaronson, A. Wigderson (2008), "Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory",
STOC 2008, Theorem 5.3, p.23 of the PDF (resources/downloads/aaronson_wigderson_2008.pdf) gives the
algebrization barrier.

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (rank-only witness does not use oracle-specific features).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented XOR-step lines and check rank-2 witness stability.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the rank witness becomes a large constructive property.
  - Largeness: unknown; needs >= 2^{-poly(n)} bound.
  - Constructivity: unknown; decidable in poly(2^n) from truth-table?
  - Usefulness: would separate the class from random functions, triggering RR97.
  - Exit point: require a non-large or non-constructive witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrizing oracle for the XOR-step claim. [AW08]
