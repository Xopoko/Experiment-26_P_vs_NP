# Q43.S361 barrier certificate

Goal: prove non-largeness (density < 2^{-poly(n)}) for the band-log2 predicate to exit the
RR97 natural-proofs barrier.
Blocker: the predicate is defined by explicit log2 thresholds and is computable in poly time,
so a density proof would require strong counting/anti-concentration bounds that are not
present in the current repo. Without such bounds, we cannot certify non-largeness.

Exact citation: A. Razborov, S. Rudich (1997), "Natural Proofs", JCSS,
Theorem 4.1, p.3 of the PDF (resources/downloads/razborov_rudich_1997.pdf).
This theorem shows that large constructive properties trigger the natural-proofs barrier,
so failing to establish non-largeness blocks the StepID goal.
