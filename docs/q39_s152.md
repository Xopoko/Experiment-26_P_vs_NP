# Q39.S152 exit plan (reduction)
Goal: escape relativization by linking the XOR-step to a non-relativizing PIT/IPS soundness instance.
Reduction: translate the XOR-step witness into an arithmetic circuit identity and a PIT axiom obligation.
Mapping: encode XOR clauses as linear polynomials over F2 and lift to IPS soundness (see Lemma 15.7.3).
Dependencies: docs/15_proof_complexity.md Lemma 15.7.3; formal/Notes/TseitinQ39.lean Section 16.153-16.177.
Subgoal: show the translation is poly-time and preserves bounded-depth structure.
Next: formalize the mapping lemma in formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean.
