Q43.S283-gap-min-global-succ-use (Proof artifact).

- Added `Q43_gap_min_ratio_drop_global_grid_of_succ_le` to recover the strict drop
  from the +1 bound without re-expanding `Q43_gap_min_ratio_k`.
- `Q43_gap_min_ratio_drop_global_grid` now uses this eliminator.
- Lean anchor: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
