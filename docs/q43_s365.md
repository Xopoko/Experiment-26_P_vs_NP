# Q43.S365 natural-proof barrier note
Goal: make the natural-proofs obstruction for the support-witness predicate explicit before attempting to stretch the band-log2 jump into a Lean implementation.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s364.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
Exact citation:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — any large and constructive property cannot separate a strong hardness assumption from `P/poly`.
Notes:
- The support-witness predicate is constructive (checkable in deterministic polytime) and dense (at least 1/poly(n) of the k-bit patterns admit the drop), so it qualifies as a natural property.
- Theorem 4.1 hence blocks building the predicate as stated unless we break the largeness/constructivity assumptions (e.g., via global support or nonuniform advice).
- Recording this exact citation commits the open question to a natural-proofs exit: the next step searches for non-natural lifts or accepts the barrier.
