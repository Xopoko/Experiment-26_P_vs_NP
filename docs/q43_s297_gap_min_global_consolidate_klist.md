Q43.S297-gap-min-global-consolidate-klist (Proof artifact).
- Removed the unused gap-range endpoint checks and list scan around k=12.
- Keeps only the explicit k=12 witness and the uniform n_k drop lemma.
- Reduces toy scaffolding around gap-min bookkeeping.
- Lean anchor: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
- Notes: refactor only; proof behavior unchanged.
