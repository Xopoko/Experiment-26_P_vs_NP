# Q39.S147 barrier certificate (natural-proofs guardrail)

- Target: nonrelativizing XOR-step simulation in bounded-depth Frege based on rank-2 witnesses.
- Barrier: upgrading the witness to a large, constructive property of Boolean functions would be a natural proof.
- Exact citation: A. Razborov, S. Rudich (1997), "Natural Proofs", JCSS, Theorem 4.1, p.3.

- Mapping: any route that certifies the XOR-step via such a natural property is blocked under RR97 (PRF assumption);
  a successful approach must violate largeness or constructivity.
- NextStepID: Q39.S148-oracle-xor-step-model-stress.

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown (rank-only reasoning appears oracle-agnostic).
  - If no: N/A.
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle gates in the XOR-step lines; check rank-2 witness stability.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes.
  - Largeness: unknown.
  - Constructivity: unknown.
  - Usefulness: would need to separate bounded-depth Frege lines from general Frege lines.
  - Exit point: use a non-natural or non-constructive witness.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown.
  - Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If no: N/A.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrizing oracle.
