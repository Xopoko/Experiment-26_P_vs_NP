# Q43.S347 band/log2 split cleanup

- Added `Q43_gap_right_k0_le_log2_of_not_lt` to package the `¬n<2^(...)` -> log2 bound.
- Simplified the high branch of `Q43_hrThreshold_of_quasipoly_gap_right` to use the helper.
- Removed the local `L := log2(grid_size n)` alias from the split.
- Low branch continues to use the shared setup bundle unchanged.
- Touches only `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` plus this note.
