# Q43.S374 nonuniform-support-witness finalize3 (blocked)
Goal: document that the entropy-stopper policy still forbids the per-instance support witness layout (advice bits + lineMax orientation) so the uniform gap drop remains pending; once the policy allows the witness, rerun the grid ratio argument and record the drop.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s373.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`, `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — without the witness the dense predicate stays large and constructive, so RR97 bars the uniform drop.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — algebraic extensions still require the advice bits, so the barrier remains whenever the witness is missing.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 4.2 vs threshold 2.5), so the witness layout cannot be formalized yet and the uniform gap drop stays blocked.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S375-nonuniform-support-witness-finalize4` once the entropy score drops and the layout can be encoded.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: random advice states cannot rebuild the layout, so the barrier stays nonrelativizing.
  - If yes: the advice must endure extension queries, keeping the barrier tied to advice persistence.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes — without the witness the predicate remains large and constructive, so RR97 forbids the gap drop.
  - Largeness: the gap-left/gap-right families keep density ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until the witness anchors the layout.
  - Constructivity: the advice witness destroys the single poly-time generator; the stopper only allows it once the entropy score drops.
  - Usefulness: the predicate separates the circuit class from random functions once it is grounded by the witness.
  - Exit point: once the policy lets us formalize the witness the RR97 barrier dissolves.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: advice prevents polynomial extension oracles from reconstructing the layout.
  - If yes: the advice must be reintroduced in algebraic oracles for the barrier to remain visible.
