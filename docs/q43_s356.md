# Q43.S356 barrier certificate

This run records a barrier for the band-log2 retry: the step uses only arithmetic/log2
inequalities and local evaluation predicates, so any conclusion is fully relativizing.

Claim 1, p.1 of the PDF (resources/downloads/jkatz_relativization_2005.pdf) constructs an oracle B
that defeats any fixed deterministic polynomial-time oracle machine, yielding P^B != NP^B within the
oracle framework described in the opening paragraph.

Exact citation: A. Razborov, S. Rudich (1997), "Natural Proofs", JCSS, Theorem 4.1, p.3 of the PDF
(resources/downloads/razborov_rudich_1997.pdf) shows that large constructive properties would yield
strong circuit lower bounds, triggering the natural-proofs barrier.

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (arithmetic/log2 inequalities are oracle-agnostic).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented evaluation rules and check band thresholds.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the evaluation predicate is promoted to a large constructive property.
  - Largeness/Constructivity: unknown; must be bounded to avoid RR97.
  - Usefulness: would distinguish from random functions, triggering RR97.
  - Exit point: require a non-large or non-constructive witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrization oracle for the evaluation predicate. [AW08]
