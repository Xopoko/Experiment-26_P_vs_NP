# Q43.S317 n0 ratio bridge
Artifact: Proof.
Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemma `Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_pow5_scaled_simple_of_ratio`).
Statement: for n>=2, a ratio bound `2*C*c1 <= grid_ratio n` implies the scaled log2^5 threshold.
Use: lets explicit n0 checks be stated as ratio comparisons; `Q43_toy_n0_C1_ok` now uses it.
Next: lift ratio bounds across plateaus/jumps to get explicit n0(c) for log2^c scaling.
