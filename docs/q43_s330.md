# Q43.S330 gap-right HR threshold

We combine the gap-right flat-eval statement with the HR threshold lemma.
This yields a direct `Q43_hrThreshold` conclusion under the quasi-poly
bounds plus `n0(C) <= n < 2^(k0(C)+1)` for `C = (log2 |F|)^c`, with the
only extra inputs being `c <= 3` and `s <= n/32`.
