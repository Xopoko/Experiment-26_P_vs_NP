# Q43.S372 nonuniform-support-witness finalize (blocked)
Goal: record that the entropy-stopper policy keeps us from formalizing the per-instance support witness layout (the algorithmic witness that pins down the contiguous `k`-line orientations, advice bits, and `lineMax` increments) until the score cools; once the policy allows, the witness should be locked in and the ratio drop rerun.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s371.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`, `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — the dense predicate is constructive until the advice witness is written, so RR97 blocks any uniform formalization.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — algebraic extensions need the same advice bits, which is why the barrier persists when the witness is missing.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 3.6 vs threshold 2.5), so this witness cannot be formalized now.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S373-nonuniform-support-witness-finalize2` once the entropy score drops and the layout can be encoded.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: arbitrary oracles cannot rebuild the advice-driven layout, so the barrier stays nonrelativizing.
  - If yes: we still need the advice to survive extension queries, so the barrier hinges on advice persistence.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes — without the witness the predicate remains large and constructive, so RR97 forbids the gap drop.
  - Largeness: the gap-left/gap-right families keep density ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until we anchor the witness.
  - Constructivity: the advice witness destroys the single poly-time generator; the stopper only allows it when the entropy score drops.
  - Exit point: once the policy helps us write the witness, RR97 no longer applies.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: advice prevents polynomial extensions from reconstructing the layout.
  - If yes: the advice must be reintroduced in algebraic oracles for the barrier to stay visible.
