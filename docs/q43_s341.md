# Q43.S341 — gap-right split simplification

- Goal: simplify the `hhi/¬hhi` split in the gap-right HR threshold proof.
- Action: reuse `Q43_gap_right_apply_n0` and `Q43_flat_eval_statement_of_quasipoly_gap_right`.
- Effect: removes manual `2 <= n` and scaled-threshold scaffolding from the `hhi` branch.
- Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (theorem `Q43_hrThreshold_of_quasipoly_gap_right`).
- Status: proof remains in WIP; no change to hypotheses or conclusions.
