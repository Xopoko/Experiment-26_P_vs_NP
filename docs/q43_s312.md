# Q43.S312 flat eval HR log2 bound
Artifact: Proof.
Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemma `Q43_hrThreshold_log2_bound_of_scaled`).
Assumption: `c <= 3` and the scaled log2^5 threshold with `C = (log2 |F|)^c`.
Idea: compare exponents to rewrite the scaled threshold into a square bound and drop to `n/16`.
Outcome: obtains the HR log2 bound `(log2 |F|)^(c+1) <= n/16` for the grid regime.
Next: remove the `c <= 3` restriction or replace it with an explicit `n0` bound.
