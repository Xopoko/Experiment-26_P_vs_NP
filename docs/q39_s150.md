# Q39.S150 barrier note

Entropy stopper halted the XOR-step cooldown run before new progress.
The rank-only witness appears oracle-agnostic, so it relativizes and
risks natural-proofs-style largeness/constructivity if generalized. [BGS75] [RR97]

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (oracle access does not affect rank-only reasoning).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented XOR-step lines and compare rank-2 stability.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the witness is promoted to a large constructive property.
  - Largeness/Constructivity: unknown; needs explicit bounds.
  - Usefulness: would separate the class from random functions, triggering RR97.
  - Exit point: require a non-constructive or non-large witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrization oracle for the XOR-step claim. [AW08]
