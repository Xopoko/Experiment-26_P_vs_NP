# Q43.S359 barrier certificate

This run records a barrier for the PIT/IPS mapping lemma: the planned proof uses only
arithmetic/log2 reasoning and local evaluation predicates, so the mapping remains fully
relativizing and risks the natural-proofs framework if the gap predicate is made large and
constructive.

Exact citation: J. Katz, "Lecture on Relativization" (Notes on Complexity Theory; last updated 2008),
Claim 1, p.1 of the PDF (resources/downloads/jkatz_relativization_2005.pdf) constructs an oracle B
with P^B != NP^B, so any fully relativizing mapping lemma cannot settle P vs NP.

Exact citation: A. Razborov, S. Rudich (1997), "Natural Proofs", JCSS,
Theorem 4.1, p.3 of the PDF (resources/downloads/razborov_rudich_1997.pdf) shows that no
P/poly-natural lower bound proof exists unless every PRG in P/poly has hardness H(G_k) >= 2^{k^epsilon};
thus a large constructive band-log2 predicate would fall into the RR97 barrier under the stated
assumption.

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (mapping lemma uses arithmetic/log2 and local evaluation only).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented PIT axioms and check the mapping survives.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the band-log2 predicate is large and constructive.
  - Largeness: unproven; must be bounded to avoid RR97.
  - Constructivity: if shown via poly-time evaluation, triggers RR97.
  - Usefulness: would separate from random functions in the RR97 framework.
  - Exit point: enforce non-large or non-constructive witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrization oracle for PIT axioms. [AW08]
