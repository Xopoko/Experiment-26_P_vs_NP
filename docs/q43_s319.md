# Q43.S319 upper plateau lift
Artifact: Proof.
Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemma `Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_pow5_scaled_simple_of_ratio_plateau_upper`).
Statement: ratio bound at `3·2^(k-1)` lifts across the upper plateau to the scaled log2^5 threshold.
Use: completes the plateau side of the lift; remaining gap interval needs a bridge.
Next: treat the gap interval or jump bridge for explicit n0(c).
