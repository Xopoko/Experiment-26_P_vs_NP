# Q43.S362 barrier certificate

Goal: show non-constructivity for the band-log2 predicate to exit the RR97 barrier.
Blocker: RR97 defines constructivity as membership in P given the truth table (Section 2.1,
"Constructivity" paragraph, PDF p.2). The band-log2 predicate is specified by explicit
log2 inequalities, and we currently lack any argument that it is non-constructive under
that definition, so the constructivity-exit route stalls.

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown (constructivity definition is oracle-agnostic).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented truth-table predicates; check that the constructivity test remains poly-time.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes.
  - Largeness: unknown.
  - Constructivity: RR97 Section 2.1 defines constructivity as P-time truth-table decidability.
  - Usefulness: if large and constructive, RR97 Thm. 4.1 triggers.
  - Exit point: find a non-constructive predicate or change the mapping to avoid a property-based lower bound.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: relate to AW08-style algebrization oracles for PIT/IPS.
