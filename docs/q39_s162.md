# Q39.S162 gadget toy run retry
Goal: re-run `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py --alt 118` after the entropy-stopper pre-check allowed the toy, and record whether the gadget continues to preserve rank 2 under oracle-specific support bits.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s161.md`, `docs/q39_s160.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`, `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — the gadget must break the continuation of uniform rank-2 witnesses.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — the toy check shows whether the oracle-specific support bit forces a deviation.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — algebraic oracles preserve XOR arithmetic unless the gadget introduces advice.
- `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py` (toy output) — records the current altitude and the persisting rank.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check returned `CONTINUE` (score 2.4), so we re-ran the toy with the gadget support guard plugged into the contiguous alt-shift.
- Output: `Toy check: Q39 contiguous alt-shift rank-2 witness` / `rank=2` with vectors `vec1=111111011111` and `vec2=111111111111` (ones at positions `[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,10,11]` and `[0..11]` respectively).
- Because the rank stayed at 2 despite the gadget, the barrier persists; the next step is `Q39.S163-gadget-support-audit`, where we will inspect whether the gadget guard needs additional oracle data or a different obstruction.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: no: the gadget guard is already oracle-specific, and the toy run shows it still fails to drop the rank in the uniform setting.
  - Exit point: extend the guard to include more support bits or change the gadget so that the relativizing continuation breaks; see the follow-up `Q39.S163-gadget-support-audit`.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (the issue is purely about gadget/shift invariants).
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (the gadget must also escape AW08-style algebraic extensions to avoid replicating the XOR symmetry).
  - Algebraizing?: unknown (the toy does not yet address algebraic oracles).
