# Q43.S321 gap-bridge bound

We isolate the inequality `n_k+1 <= 3·2^(k-1)` (k>=1) as a helper lemma,
extracted from the floor-sqrt argument inside `Q43_nk_succ_sq_lt`.
This formalizes that the log2-jump base point sits before the upper plateau
boundary, so the gap-right lift can be applied at `n = 3*2^(k-1)` once a
base ratio at `n_k+1` is known.

Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemma `Q43_nk_succ_le_three_pow`, used in
`Q43_nk_succ_sq_lt`).
