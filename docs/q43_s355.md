# Q43.S355 barrier note

Entropy stopper halted the band-log2 reset run before new progress.
The step still relies on arithmetic/log2 inequalities that relativize, so it cannot by itself
provide a nonrelativizing ingredient. [BGS75]

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (oracle access does not change the inequality reasoning).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented evaluation rules and check band thresholds.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the evaluation scheme yields a large constructive property.
  - Largeness/Constructivity: unknown; needs explicit bounds.
  - Usefulness: would distinguish from random functions, triggering RR97.
  - Exit point: require a non-large or non-constructive witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrization oracle for the evaluation predicate. [AW08]
