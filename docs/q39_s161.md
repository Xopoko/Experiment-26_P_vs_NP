# Q39.S161 gadget toy run (blocked)
Goal: re-run `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py --alt 118` with the gadget-augmented contiguous shift to see whether the rank-2 witness survives once the oracle-specific support bit is enforced.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s160.md`, `docs/q39_s159.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`, `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`.
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — even oracle simulations cannot keep the gadget from adding a support-level dependency.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — the toy check must break the continuation of uniform shifts if the gadget works.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — the gadget must also resist algebraic oracles if it is to change the rank outcome.
- `scripts/stopper_advice.py` policy v1 — records entropy score 3.8 that currently forbids the toy run.
Notes:
- The pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 3.8 ≥ 2.5), so we cannot execute the toy yet.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q39.S162-gadget-toy-run-retry` once the entropy policy drops below the threshold.
- The artifact is a barrier note capturing the STOP decision; resume by replaying this run once the policy yields `CONTINUE`.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown (the gadget is expected to break the purely algebraic shift, but we need the toy to confirm).
  - If no: the gadget still behaves uniformly and the barrier remains; further plan would revisit the gadget design.
  - Exit point: the gadget is supposed to force the shift to read oracle-specific support bits, so the next run should drop the rank if the gadget succeeded.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (the focus is on relativization rather than large predicate construction).
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (AW08-style extensions preserve XOR/right arithmetic unless the gadget breaks them).
  - Algebraizing?: unknown (dependent on how the gadget interacts with algebraic oracles).
  - Exit point: when the gadget produces a rank drop under an algebraic extension, we leave the barrier.
