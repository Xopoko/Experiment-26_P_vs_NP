# Q43.S366 natural-proof escape blocked by entropy stopper
Goal: record that the planned non-natural support predicate work was interrupted by the entropy-stopper policy before we could start formalizing the idea.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s365.md`, `docs/open_questions.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — the uniform support predicate is natural and must violate largeness/constructivity to escape.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — polynomial extensions still preserve the XOR-style obstruction.
Notes:
- The new run would have kept the same lens (barrier-driven design) and tried to define a support predicate that enforces global support/advice to break the natural-proofs largeness/constructivity requirements.
- A STOP (score 2.8 in the latest check, matching the ≥2.5 cutoff) indicates repeated failure signals: the policy sees alternating attempts (S364 and S365) with no InfoGain increase, so it requests a pause before the next barrier attempt.
- The entropy score of 2.5 matches the cutoff in `scripts/stopper_advice.py` policy v1, so the policy emits `STOP`; see `agent/logs/*.log` for the trace.
- Next step: wait for the policy score to fall (by working on a different track or adding a substantive artifact), then re-issue `Q43.S366-escape-natural-proof` or move to `Q43.S367-nonuniform-support-implementation` with a refreshed idea.
BarrierCheck:
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes (support predicate remained constructive and dense).
  - Largeness: ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} (witnessed by the uniform gap-drop regime), so RR97 applies.
  - Constructivity: deterministic verification in poly(n), hence the property is natural.
  - Usefulness: would separate the flat local-EF(s) schema from `P/poly` if built.
  - Exit point: pause after the entropy-stopper score hits the threshold, then reconsider the predicate (e.g., by adding advice or global support).
- Citations: [RR97], [AW08], [scripts/stopper_advice.py policy v1].
