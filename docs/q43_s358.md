# Q43.S358 reduction note
Target: reduce the band-log2 gap evaluation to a PIT/IPS soundness instance.
Construction: encode the band-log2 witness as a circuit family F_k with identity F_k = 0.
Claim: flat-eval bounds imply PIT axioms for F_k, yielding IPS soundness obligations.
Lean target: formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean (add defs for F_k and the eval predicate).
Dependencies: docs/15_proof_complexity.md Lemma 15.7.3; formal/Notes/TseitinLocalEF.lean Section 16.191-16.280.
Next: prove the mapping is poly-time and that cost-t eval maps to the PIT axiom instance.
