# Q39.S146 barrier certificate (rank-2 contiguous shift)

- Aim: classify the contiguous alt-shift rank-2 regime into a bounded-depth Frege XOR-step simulation.
- Barrier mapping: any upgrade of the rank-2 witness into a large/constructive property usable for a general lower bound would fall under the natural-proofs framework.
- Exact citation: Razborov, Rudich (1997) "Natural Proofs", JCSS, Thm. 4.1, p.3 (../resources/downloads/razborov_rudich_1997.pdf).
- Conclusion: this step does not, by itself, bypass the natural-proofs barrier for the global separation goal.
- NextStepID: Q39.S147-nonrelativizing-xor-step-oracle-break.
