# Q43.S320 gap-right lift

We show that `Nat.log2 (Q43_grid_size n)` stays at `2*k+1` on the interval
`Q43_nk k + 1 <= n < 2^(k+1)`, which makes `Q43_grid_ratio` monotone there.
This lifts the ratio bound at `n_k+1` across the gap-right segment and
feeds directly into the scaled HR log2^5 threshold statement.
