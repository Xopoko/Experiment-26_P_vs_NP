Q43.S308 note

- Purpose: apply the regime-d bundle to lineMax using proofSize in the quasi-poly regime.
- Lemma: Q43_quasipoly_regime_d_ok_param_lineMax.
- Inputs: n>=2, N/proofSize <= 2^(log2|F|)^(c+1), and the scaled log2^5 condition.
- Output: Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param n N and tParam(lineMax) <= (log2|F|)^(c+1).
