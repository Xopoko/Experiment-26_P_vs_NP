# Q43.S346 shared setup reuse

- Reused `Q43_gap_right_flat_eval_setup` directly in `Q43_hrThreshold_of_quasipoly_gap_right`.
- Low-branch now derives `2 <= n`, scaled threshold, and flat-eval via the shared bundle.
- Removes duplicated `L := log2(grid_size n)` plumbing in the low regime.
- Keeps the band/log2 branch unchanged for the high regime split.
- Touches only `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` plus this note.
