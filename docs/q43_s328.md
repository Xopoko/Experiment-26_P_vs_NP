# Q43.S328 gap-right n0 supplies n>=2

We add a small bridge lemma showing `Q43_gap_right_n0 C >= 2`, so the
n0 lower bound implies the `2 <= n` precondition needed by the regime-d
wrapper. This lets `Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param_of_gap_right_n0` drop its
explicit `2 <= n` assumption and derive it from `n0(C) <= n`.

Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemmas
`Q43_gap_right_n0_ge_two`, updated `Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param_of_gap_right_n0`).
