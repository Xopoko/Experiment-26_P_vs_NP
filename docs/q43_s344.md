# Q43.S344 toy check (gap-right log2 jump)

- Script: `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
- Range: k=12..104
- Result: all lines end with `-> ok` (log2 jump at n_k and ratio drop hold).
- Interpretation: the n_k log2 jump consistently matches the gap-right drop in the tested band,
  so the shared flat-eval setup can reuse the jump lemma without extra case splits.
