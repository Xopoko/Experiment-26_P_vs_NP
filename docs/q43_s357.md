# Q43.S357 exit plan (reduction)
Goal: escape relativization by linking the band-log2 gap to a PIT/IPS soundness instance.
Reduction: show that the flat-eval predicate for the gap yields a PIT axiom (or IPS soundness) instance.
Dependencies: docs/15_proof_complexity.md Lemma 15.7.3; formal/Notes/TseitinLocalEF.lean §16.191-§16.280.
Subgoal A: identify the circuit family and identity witness extracted from the band-log2 setup.
Subgoal B: prove the mapping is poly-time and preserves the cost-t evaluation bounds.
If A/B fail, record the obstruction and pivot to an oracle-stress test of the mapping.
