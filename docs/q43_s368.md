# Q43.S368 nonuniform-support-witness (blocked)
Goal: encode the per-instance support witness that commits to the contiguous `k`-line layout, orientations, and lineMax increments so the flat grid ratio drop witnesses the intended nonuniform predicate.
Dependencies: `docs/q43_s367.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`, `scripts/toy_q43_gap_sqrt2.py`
Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — constructivity is the lever being lifted by the support witness advice.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — extension oracles preserve algebraic obstructions unless the advice is reintroduced.
- `scripts/stopper_advice.py` policy v1 (entropy/score analysis) — records the current kewl decision boundary ω=2.5.
Notes:
- The pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 3.2, threshold 2.5) before any witness encoding could be written, so this step is blocked until the policy cools.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S369-nonuniform-support-witness-retry` once the entropy score drops below the threshold again.
- The artifact is intentionally a barrier note: once the model yields `CONTINUE`, the next attempt should resume from this witness plan.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: the per-instance advice is not preserved by arbitary oracles, so the barrier remains nonrelativizing.
  - If yes: the entropy witness will still be invalidated secondary to the oracle requiring uniform generation.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes: without the advice the predicate was large and constructive; RR97 continues to block uniform escapes.
  - Exit point: the planned witness is the exit once the entropy stopper allows the work to resume.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If yes: the same advice bits must be reintroduced for AW08-style oracles as well.
