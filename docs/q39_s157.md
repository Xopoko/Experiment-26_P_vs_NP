# Q39.S157 contiguous alt-shift attempt blocked by entropy stopper
Goal: document that the contiguous-global-orientation alt-70 shift stays rank 2, but the `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` policy (score 1.7, cooldown) blocked the attempt before the toy/oracle could run, so we pause the uniform sequence and plan a non-relativizing gadget (S158).
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s156.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`, `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`.
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — a fully relativizing XOR translation cannot separate `P` from `NP`, so the contiguous shift cannot resolve the problem while its witness remains oracle-agnostic.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — continuing oracular XOR sequences preserves rank-2 witnesses, which keeps the wall intact across contiguous alt-shifts.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — algebraic extensions see the same XOR arithmetic, so the contiguous block is barrier-rich even under extension oracles.
- Python `scripts/stopper_advice.py` policy v1 (`scripts/stopper_policy.json`) — the entropy-stopper pre-check returned `STOP` (score 1.7, cooldown) for S157, so the oracle could not run.
Notes:
- The toy definitions `Q39_globalfixedpair_fixedorientation_contiguous_shift_alt70_vec*` already exist in `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`; they extend the previous alt-69 pair by one additional `true`, so the expected rank-2 witness is still present.
- Instead of running the toy, the pre-check was triggered by repeated contiguous attempts, so we did not execute the oracle; this run is thus recorded as a barrier note before exploring a new gadget.
- Next step: pursue `Q39.S158-nonrelativizing-gadget` that inserts an oracle-specific structure into the contiguous scheme, breaking the arithmetic-only translation and allowing a nonrelativizing evaluation before returning to the contiguous block series.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (the XOR mapping uses arithmetic/log2 plus contiguous prefix counting, all of which commute with any oracle).
  - If no: there is no nonrelativizing dependency yet, so the contiguous shift cannot escape the barrier.
  - Exit point: the gadget in S158 must introduce oracle-tied information (e.g., a global support bit) that renders the witness non-relativizing.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (the barrier arises from translation invariants, not density/constructivity properties).
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (AW08 shows that algebraic extensions preserve the XOR arithmetic, so this block remains barrier in AW08-style oracles).
