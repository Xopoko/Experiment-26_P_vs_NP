# Q43.S313 HR log2 bound counterexample (c=9)
Artifact: Counterexample.
Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
Statement refuted: scaled log2^5 threshold with C=(log2 |F|)^c implies HR log2 bound for all c.
Witness: c=9, n=13356869453140769898496; scaled threshold holds but HR log2 bound fails.
Impact: removing the c<=3 restriction needs extra assumptions (e.g., explicit n0 or different scaling).
