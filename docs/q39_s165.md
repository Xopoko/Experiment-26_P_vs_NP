# Q39.S165 globalfixedpair-fixedorientation-contiguous-shift-alt78 (blocked)
Goal: rerun the gadget support audit on the next contiguous shift (alt78) to see whether extra per-output support bits or orientation metadata can break the persistent rank-2 witness; log why the entropy-stopper policy still forbids the inspection so the plan stays paused.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s163.md`, `docs/q39_s164.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`, `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py`
Exact citations:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question* (Thm. 1, p.15) — any gadget must disrupt the uniform oracle continuation to expose the rank-2 witness.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — the toy check reveals the next contiguous shift still obeys XOR symmetry unless additional advice breaks it.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — algebraic oracles keep the XOR rank invariant until the gadget encodes per-output advice.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `python3 scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 5.1 vs threshold 2.5, signals `repeat_failure` and `zero_infogain_streak>=2`), so the gadget audit remains blocked and we await a cooler policy.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q39.S166-globalfixedpair-fixedorientation-contiguous-shift-alt79` once the entropy score drops and the policy allows another shift inspection.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: the gadget must demonstrate how the uniform oracle continuation is disrupted, but the policy never let the audit run.
  - Exit point: once the policy clears, checking alt79 should reveal the extra support bits needed.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no (we target gadget invariants, not large constructive predicates).
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: yes (AW08-style extension oracles still stabilize XOR rank, so the gadget needs advice bits to reroute the shift).
  - Algebraizing?: unknown (empirical audit blocked by the policy).
