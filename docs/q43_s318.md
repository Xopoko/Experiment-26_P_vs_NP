# Q43.S318 plateau lift
Artifact: Proof.
Lean: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (lemma `Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_pow5_scaled_simple_of_ratio_plateau`).
Statement: a ratio bound at 2^k lifts across the lower plateau to the scaled log2^5 threshold.
Use: transfers explicit n0 checks along plateau; `Q43_toy_n0_C1_ok` now uses this lift.
Next: extend to upper plateau and the gap interval for explicit n0(c).
