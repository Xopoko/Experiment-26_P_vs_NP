# Q43.S371 nonuniform-support-witness retry3
Goal: pause again because the entropy-stopper pre-check score rose to 3.5, so we cannot touch the per-instance support witness layout until the policy cools; record the blockage before rerunning the witness encoding once the advice layout stabilizes.

Exact citations:
- Razborov, Rudich (1997), *Natural Proofs*, Theorem 4.1 (p.3) — a dense, constructive predicate cannot cross the barrier without additional advice bits.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory*, Theorem 5.3 (p.23) — AW08-style oracles keep the XOR obstruction alive unless the advice witness is reintroduced.
Notes:
- The stopper pre-check `scripts/stopper_advice.py --mode pre` returned `STOP` (score 3.5 vs threshold 2.5) before any witness encoding could begin, so we pause until the policy drops.
- BlockerType: `BARRIER_ENTROPY`.
- NextStepID: `Q43.S372-nonuniform-support-witness-finalize` once the entropy score falls and the advice layout can be formalized.
BarrierCheck:
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: unknown
  - If no: the per-instance advice cannot be reconstructed uniformly, so any oracle that forbids advice will still block the witness.
  - If yes: we still need to ensure the layout survives uniform extension queries, so we keep the barrier focused on advice persistence.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes because the uniform predicate is dense and constructive; the STOP just records that we cannot inject advice yet.
  - Largeness: the candidate gap-left/gap-right families remain ≥ 2^{-poly(n)} until the witness is encoded.
  - Constructivity: the planned advice witness destroys the single poly-time generator, but the stopper keeps us from writing it down while the policy is hot.
  - Exit point: once the entropy stopper decision returns CONTINUE, we will formalize the witness and leave the RR97 framework.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown
  - Algebraizing?: unknown
  - If no: advice corrupts polynomial extensions and the barrier persists until the witness is anchored.
  - If yes: the same advice must be woven into algebraic extensions to keep the barrier visible.
