# Q43.S352 barrier note

This step uses only arithmetic/log2 band invariants to push toward a uniform
polylog-cost evaluation scheme. Under that condition the argument is oracle-
agnostic, so it relativizes and cannot by itself be the nonrelativizing step
needed for a separation-level conclusion. [BGS75]

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (oracle access does not affect the log2 band inequalities).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented evaluation rules and compare k-band thresholds.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the scheme yields a large constructive property on truth tables.
  - Largeness/Constructivity: unknown; needs explicit bounds.
  - Usefulness: would separate the evaluation predicate from random functions, triggering RR97.
  - Exit point: require a non-constructive or non-large witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrization oracle for the evaluation predicate. [AW08]
