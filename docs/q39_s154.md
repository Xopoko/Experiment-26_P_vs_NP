# Q39.S154 oracle-xor-nonrelativizing-exit note
Goal: make the relativization obstruction explicit for the XOR-step mapping and plan the follow-up classification of the contiguous alt-shift regime.
Dependencies: `docs/q39_s153.md`, `formal/WIP/Verified/Q39.lean`.
Exact citation:
- Baker, Gill, Solovay (1975), *Relativizations of the P = ? NP Question*, SIAM J. Comput. (Thm. 1, p. 15) — there exists an oracle `B` with `P^B ≠ NP^B`, so any XOR mapping that relativizes cannot settle P vs. NP.
- Katz (2005), *Relativizing the P vs. NP Question* (Claim 1, p.1) — reinterprets the oracle separation for the XOR/gate setting and points to XOR-circuits that remain invariant under oracle additions.
- Aaronson, Wigderson (2008), *Algebrization: A New Barrier in Complexity Theory* (Thm. 5.3, p.23) — even with algebraic extensions, the XOR-step mapping is not preserved.
Notes:
- The XOR-step uses only arithmetic/log2 and syntactic XOR rewrites, which all commute with adding an oracle. Thus the mapping is fully relativizing and cannot prove `P ≠ NP` absent a non-relativizing insight.
- Test scenario: insert oracle gates that flip bits after each XOR application (Katz 2005); the witnesses from `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py` survive and the alleged path to `P ≠ NP` carries over to `P^B ≠ NP^B`, so the barrier is manifested.
- Next step: either classify the contiguous alt-shift regime (look for structural constraints beyond XOR) or find a non-relativizing escape (e.g., via an interactive or randomised extension); see `Q39.S155-contiguous-alt-shift-classification`.
BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (mapping only deploys arithmetic/log2 and XOR syntax).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented XOR gates and verify the map remains intact; run `scripts/toy_q39_rank2.py` with oracle-flagged XOR steps.
  - Known oracle counterexample: Baker–Gill–Solovay (1975) explicit `B` with `P^B ≠ NP^B`.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: no.
  - Largeness: N/A.
  - Constructivity: N/A.
  - Usefulness: N/A.
  - Exit point: N/A.
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown.
  - Algebraizing?: yes (XOR is preserved by extension oracles that lift bits to polynomials).
  - If yes: reduce to Aaronson–Wigderson 2008 Thm. 5.3 (p.23) showing the extension also fails.
