# Q43.S364 support-witness reduction note
Goal: hide the band-log2 threshold behind a support-witness existential predicate so that the mapping is no longer about a single truth table value.
Reduction: rewrite the predicate as "exists a support pattern S where the grid-ratio drop occurs across the log2 jump" so validating the predicate requires exploring S rather than reading a fixed bit.
Dependencies: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean` (Q43_grid_ratio_drop_nk_of_ge, Q43_gap_right_flat_eval_setup) plus `docs/q43_s363.md` (predicate refactor narrative).
Next: formalize `SupportWitness` in Lean, show the PIT/IPS reduction still follows, and record why the new predicate avoids a P-time truth-table check.
