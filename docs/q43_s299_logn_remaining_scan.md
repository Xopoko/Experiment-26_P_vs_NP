Q43.S299-logn-remaining-scan (Proof artifact).
- Added `Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_param_of_log2` to isolate the log2 N parameter.
- Routed `Q43_thm41_log2_threshold_c1_grid_param_of_le` through the new lemma.
- Removed the stale TODO for the remaining logN scan.
- Lean anchor: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
- Notes: refactor only; proof behavior unchanged.
