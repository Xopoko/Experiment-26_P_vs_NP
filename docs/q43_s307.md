Q43.S307 note

- Purpose: bundle regime-d log2 threshold, |F| >= c1, and quasi-poly t-parameter bounds.
- Lemmas: Q43_thm41_c1_le_grid_of_scaled, Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param_of_scaled,
  Q43_quasipoly_regime_d_ok_param_tParam.
- Inputs: n>=2, N/M <= 2^(log2|F|)^(c+1), and the scaled log2^5 condition.
- Output: Q43_thm41_regime_d_ok_param n N with Q43_tParam M <= (log2|F|)^(c+1).
