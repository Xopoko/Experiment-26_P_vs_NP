Q43.S304-flat-eval-quasipoly-bridge (Proof artifact).
- Added `Q43_tParam_lineMax_le_polylog_of_quasipoly_grid` to specialize the quasi-poly bound to `Q43_grid_size`.
- This bridges the lineMax bound into the grid-size regime used by the flat evaluation statement.
- Lean anchor: `formal/WIP/Verified/Q43.lean`.
- Note: marked `[simp]` to simplify repeated grid-size specializations.
