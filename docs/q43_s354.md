# Q43.S354 barrier note

Entropy stopper halted the band-log2 cooldown review before new progress.
The approach remains arithmetic/inequality driven and therefore relativizes,
so it cannot serve as the nonrelativizing step by itself. [BGS75]

BarrierCheck
- Relativization:
  - Relativizes?: yes (oracle access does not affect the log2 band inequalities).
  - If yes/unknown: test with oracle-augmented evaluation rules and compare band thresholds.
- NaturalProofs:
  - Applicable?: yes, if the evaluation scheme yields a large constructive property.
  - Largeness/Constructivity: unknown; needs explicit bounds.
  - Usefulness: would separate the predicate from random functions, triggering RR97.
  - Exit point: require a non-constructive or non-large witness. [RR97]
- Algebrization:
  - Applicable?: unknown; Algebraizing?: unknown.
  - If yes/unknown: reduce to an AW08-style algebrization oracle for the evaluation predicate. [AW08]
