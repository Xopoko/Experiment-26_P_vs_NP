# Q43.S325 gap-right apply k0

We fold the bound `n_k+1 <= 3*2^(k-1)` into the gap-right lift.
The lemma now accepts `3*2^(k-1) <= n` and `k>=k0(C)`,
then derives `n_k+1 <= n` internally and applies the gap-right monotonicity.
This yields the scaled log2^5 threshold for any n in
`[3*2^(k-1), 2^(k+1))` once k is above k0(C).
