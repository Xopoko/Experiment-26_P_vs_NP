[$web-search]($CODEX_HOME/skills/web-search/SKILL.md) As WORKER: first print a "Run contract" block (SelectedItem, Priority, Artifact, StepID, LeanTarget, Oracle, FilesToTouch, StopCondition), then read docs/agent_brief.md (Do-not-repeat), pick exactly one active item from docs/open_questions.md (prefer ACTIVE P0 unless blocked/cooldown), produce exactly one verifiable artifact of type Proof/Counterexample/Exact citation/Toy/Reduction/Barrier with a barrier check, StepID and InfoGain, use `LeanTarget` from the selected item; before a Lean proof attempt run retrieval (`rg` over formal/ and resources/text_cache/ and #find/simp?/aesop? if available); if the artifact = Proof, must add real Lean code (def/theorem) in the specified file; keep long notes in formal/Notes/*.lean, run novelty-check locally (rg over formal/, docs/ and resources/text_cache/), in asymptotics always clarify what `exp` means: `e^x` vs `2^x` (and remember `exp((log n)^k)` for `k>1` is superpolynomial), and if there is no source then search via firecrawl and record the exact link; then minimally update docs/open_questions.md, docs/agent_brief.md, and docs/artifacts.tsv (done) or docs/planned.tsv (queue) without growth, run scripts/verify_all.sh, and make one meaningful git commit.
