[$web-search]($CODEX_HOME/skills/web-search/SKILL.md) As WORKER: read docs/agent_brief.md (Do-not-repeat), pick exactly one active item from docs/open_questions.md, produce exactly one verifiable artifact of type Proof/Counterexample/Exact citation/Toy/Reduction/Barrier with a barrier check, StepID and InfoGain, use `LeanTarget` from the selected item; if the artifact = Proof, must add real Lean code (def/theorem) in the specified file; keep long notes in formal/Notes/*.lean, run novelty-check locally (rg over formal/, docs/ and resources/text_cache/), in asymptotics always clarify what `exp` means: `e^x` vs `2^x` (and remember `exp((log n)^k)` for `k>1` is superpolynomial), and if there is no source then search via firecrawl and record the exact link; then minimally update docs/open_questions.md, docs/agent_brief.md and docs/artifacts.tsv without growth, run scripts/verify_all.sh, and make one meaningful git commit.
